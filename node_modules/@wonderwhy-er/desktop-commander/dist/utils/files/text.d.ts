/**
 * Text file handler
 * Handles reading, writing, and editing text files
 *
 * Binary detection is handled at the factory level (factory.ts) using isBinaryFile.
 * This handler only receives files that have been confirmed as text.
 *
 * TECHNICAL DEBT:
 * This handler is missing editRange() - text search/replace logic currently lives in
 * src/tools/edit.ts (performSearchReplace function) instead of here.
 *
 * For architectural consistency with ExcelFileHandler.editRange(), the fuzzy
 * search/replace logic should be moved here. See comment in src/tools/edit.ts.
